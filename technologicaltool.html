                <h4>Android</h4>
                <p>The application is one that will be developed in android os. android is the world-leading os platform for mobile phones. it currently has more users than any other mobile os out in the market and the potential to reach more users in need.</p>
                <h4>Firebase</h4>
                <p>The database of the application will be handled by the firebase platform.which is a cloud base NoSQL document database. it will be used to store the user data which includes there personal details such as name, age, email. it will also be used to store the medical-related data of the user such as the blood pressure, calorie intake and the blood sugar level. firebase has so many advantages some of which include -multi-platform authentication. Your customers can now securely sign in through platforms they trust such as facebook, twitter or google. this application will also incorporate using OAuth to enable user authentication.</p>

                <p>Retrofit- its is a type-safe http client for android and java. it enable making calls to third party frame works easy.this would be used in this application to make call to third party frame works to call apis relating to health in other to provide useful feed backs to customers based on medical conditions relating to them.</p> -->
                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                <p>Github will server as the online repository that will be used in the development of this application.</p>
                <p>
                        I have been working with these tools for prior a year and I am confident I will get the job done before the expected date. I have one year experience in building android applications but I will also buff up my android skills during this project work in other to help me accomplish the task of building this application.
